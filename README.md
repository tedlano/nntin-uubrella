## What is UUbrella?
Ever found something valuable but didn't know how to return it discreetly? UUbrella lets you securely "hide" a found item in a public place, take a photo with its GPS location, and generate a unique, private link to share only with the owner for retrieval. It's like a digital dead drop for lost & found!

## How It Works
1.  **Hide:** Find a safe spot for the item.
2.  **Snap & Pin:** Use the UUbrella app to take a photo and automatically capture the GPS coordinates. Add an optional title and description.
3.  **Share:** Get a unique, secret link for the hidden item.
4.  **Retrieve:** Share the link *only* with the item's owner so they can see the photo and map location to retrieve their belongings.

## Key Features
*   **Simple Interface:** Easy-to-use form for hiding items.
*   **GPS Tagging:** Automatically records the location when you take a photo.
*   **Secure Links:** Generates unique, hard-to-guess URLs for privacy.
*   **Visual Guidance:** Displays the item photo and an interactive map on the retrieval page.
*   **Mobile Friendly:** Works smoothly on phones for hiding and finding on the go.
*   **Client-Side Image Compression:** Resizes large photos automatically for faster uploads.

## Future Enhancements
We're planning to add features like:
*   Item expiration (automatic deletion after a set time).
*   Support for multiple images per item.
*   Optional contact information field.
*   A way to report inappropriate items.
