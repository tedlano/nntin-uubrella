# GitHub Preparation Plan for UUbrella Project

This document outlines the steps needed to prepare the UUbrella project for uploading to GitHub.

## 1. Create a `.gitignore` File

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory with the following content:

```
# Node.js dependencies
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-debug.log
yarn-error.log
.pnpm-debug.log

# Python virtual environments
.venv/
venv/
ENV/
env/
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
.pytest_cache/

# Build artifacts
dist/
build/
*.tsbuildinfo
frontend/dist/

# Environment files with sensitive information
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
# Keep .env.production as it doesn't contain sensitive information

# AWS CDK output
cdk.out/
.cdk.staging/
cdk-outputs.json

# IDE-specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.swp
*.swo
.DS_Store
.project
.classpath
.settings/

# Operating system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

## 2. Sensitive Information Check

The project appears to handle sensitive information properly by using environment variables:

- AWS resources are referenced via environment variables in Lambda functions
- Frontend API URLs are stored in environment files
- No hardcoded credentials were found in the codebase

Ensure that no AWS credentials or other sensitive tokens are accidentally committed by:

1. Double-checking all files for hardcoded credentials
2. Ensuring AWS credentials are managed through AWS CLI profiles or environment variables
3. Verifying that `.env` files with sensitive information are included in `.gitignore`

## 3. README.md Enhancements

The project already has a comprehensive README.md, but consider adding:

- A project logo or screenshot of the application
- Clearer installation instructions for different operating systems
- Information about how to contribute to the project
- License information

## 4. Git Repository Setup and Push to GitHub

Follow these steps to initialize the Git repository and push to GitHub:

1. Initialize a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add the `.gitignore` file first:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Add .gitignore"
   ```

3. Add and commit the rest of the files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: UUbrella project"
   ```

4. Create a new repository on GitHub (without initializing it with README, .gitignore, or license)

5. Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/uubrella.git
   ```

6. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   (Use `master` instead of `main` if your default branch is named `master`)

## 5. Additional Considerations

### GitHub Actions Workflow

Consider adding GitHub Actions workflows for:

- Continuous Integration (CI) to run tests
- Continuous Deployment (CD) to deploy to AWS
- Dependency updates using Dependabot

Example workflow file structure:
```
.github/
  workflows/
    ci.yml
    deploy.yml
```

### Branch Protection Rules

Once the repository is on GitHub, set up branch protection rules for the main branch:

1. Require pull request reviews before merging
2. Require status checks to pass before merging
3. Require branches to be up to date before merging

### Issue and Pull Request Templates

Add templates for issues and pull requests to standardize contributions:

```
.github/
  ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

## 6. Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub:

1. Set up GitHub Pages if you want to host documentation
2. Configure repository settings (topics, description, etc.)
3. Add collaborators or set up a team
4. Consider setting up a project board for task tracking
